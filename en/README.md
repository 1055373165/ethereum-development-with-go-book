# Introduction

## What is Ethereum

> Ethereum is an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system featuring smart contract (scripting) functionality.[3] It supports a modified version of Nakamoto consensus via transaction based state transitions. [1]

Ethereum is a blockchain that allows developers to create applications that can be ran completely decentralized, meaning that no single entity can take it down or modify it. Each application deployed to Ethereum is executed by every single full client on the Ethereum network.

Solidity is a turing complete programming language for writing smart contracts. Solidity gets compiled to bytecode which is what the Ethereum virtual machine exectues.
